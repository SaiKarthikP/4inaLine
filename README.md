Game 4-in-a-line Game - Project Instructions
https://www.cpp.edu/~ftang/courses/CS420/hw/project%20-%20game.htm

Overview
You have a 8x8 board, players take turns placing a piece on any grid. First player to get 4 in a line (either a row, or a column; diagonals are NOT counted) wins. The maximum amount of time allowed for generating the next move is 30 seconds. At the very beginning, your program should ask the user for the maximum amount time (in seconds) allowed for the computer to generate the answer and make sure that your search will stop when there's no time left. Your program should also ask the user to decide who is going to move first.

How to compile and run program
1. The source code is located in the folder named 'sourcecode'. 
2. Compile the program using the command 'javac Main.java' within the directory. Once it compiles, type 'java Main' and the program should run as expected.
3. Alternatively, the program should also run on any Java IDE. 


The program was coded and tested on the IntelliJ and Eclipse IDE.
